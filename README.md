# leaflet-challenge
Overview: This research project visualizes the earthquake data which is a massive amount of data from all over the world each day so that the government and public are well educated and aware regarding the health of our ecosystems. UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY is providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impact of climate and land-use change. 
Scope: This report focuses on visualizing the earthquake data from all over the world including its magnitude, depth and tectonic plates.
Methodology: 
1.	Getting the dataset from past seven data - earthquake https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php
2.	Importing the dataset â€“ D3 module 
3.	Plotting base map and adding circle radius based on its magnititude and color based on its depth
4.	Adding overlays on map - second dataset to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity
